      "title": "What Causes an Earthquake?",
      "content": "The Earth's surface is not a single piece. It's a giant puzzle made of enormous rock blocks called <b>tectonic plates</b>, which float on the planet's semi-liquid mantle. They are in constant, slow motion (a few centimeters per year). An earthquake is the vibration felt when the energy stored from this movement is suddenly released."
    },
    {
      "title": "Collision Earthquakes (Convergent Boundaries)",
      "content": "This occurs when two plates push against each other. Usually, a denser plate (oceanic) dives under a less dense one (continental) in a process called <b>subduction</b>. The diving plate doesn't slide smoothly; it gets stuck, building up immense stress. When the stress overcomes friction, the plate slips abruptly, releasing a colossal amount of energy. This is where the <b>world's strongest earthquakes</b> occur, like those in Chile and Japan, which can generate tsunamis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spreading Earthquakes (Divergent Boundaries)",
      "content": "This happens when two plates move away from each other. This movement creates cracks in the crust, allowing magma to rise from the mantle and form a new ocean floor. This process is accompanied by earthquakes, but they are generally <b>less intense and shallower</b>. Most occur in the middle of oceans, in underwater mountain ranges called mid-ocean ridges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sliding Earthquakes (Transform Boundaries)",
      "content": "This occurs when two plates slide horizontally past each other. The plate edges are not smooth, so they get locked by friction. Stress builds up over years or decades until, suddenly, the rocks break and the plates jerk forward. The most famous example is the <b>San Andreas Fault</b> in California, which marks the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate."
